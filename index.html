    <h1>How To Help With Our Cancer Patient</h1> 
   
    <p>In our world, we all know that we have problems. These problems include murder, crime, and so many other problems in our world. Yet, there is a clear issue at hand that we could contribute to solving. That problem is patients with cancer.</p>

    <p>Hospitals are full of these sickened patients, and cancer is no joke. It causes suffering to the body, physically and mentally, and this kind of issue could happen to anyone. Regardless of elderly or youth, the problem of cancer isn't inevitable. So how can we contribute?

    <p>We could start by giving more to those with Cancer, such as gifts or money to help with their surgeries and treatment! Or we could just send texts or share posts of their illness to spread awareness of Cancer. This topic is serious, and everyone needs to pay attention to those who need their illness's help.</p>

    <p> In other words, there are lots of people out there battling cancer, and we can help contribute to their illness. We can't outright fix it right away, but we can help out in our way. Every small thing like donating or raising awareness is helpful all on its own!</p>
